# Player
Iptv Ott Player with using Ministra API 

Basically, this project consists of MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) architecture and uses the Android Leanback Library to configure the overall UI/UX. The purpose of sharing this project is to update my legacy code (written in Java) to kotlin and for version control. 

However, if you look at this repo, you are welcome to refer to this project. 

Also, if you raise an issue, I absolutely promise to answer with sincerity.
